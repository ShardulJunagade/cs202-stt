# Lab Assignment 1

**Course:** CS202 Software Tools and Techniques for CSE  
**Lab Topic:** Introduction to Version Controlling, Git Workflows, and Actions  
**Date:** 04th August 2025

## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to familiarize students with the basic concepts of version control systems (VCS), understand their importance in software development and testing, and get hands-on experience with Git.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

- Understand the purpose and benefits of using version control systems.  
- Set up and configure Git on their systems.  
- Perform basic Git operations such as initializing a repository, adding files, committing changes, and viewing the commit history.  
- Learn how to work with remote repositories on GitHub.

## Pre-Lab Requirements

- Any Operating System (Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.)
- Install Git on your local machine: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- Create an account on GitHub: [Sign Up on GitHub](https://github.com/).
- Install a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code or any editor of your choice but VS is preferred).
